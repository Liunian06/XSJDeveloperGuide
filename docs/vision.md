# Project Vision

Small Phone aims to redefine how users interact with their mobile devices through AI. We believe that the future of apps is not just about better UI, but about smarter, context-aware interactions that anticipate user needs.

## Why "Small Phone"?

Because it's about making the technology disappear and the capability shine. It's about efficiency and intelligence packed into a powerful, accessible form factor.
