## Welcome to Small Phone Development

Small Phone is an ambitious project to create a truly AI-Native application experience. By leveraging a high-performance **C++ Core** for logic and AI processing, and using **Native UI** layers (Compose for Android, SwiftUI for iOS), we aim to deliver unparalleled performance and user experience.

### Key Philosophy
*   **AI First**: Built from the ground up to be AI-native, not just AI-augmented.
*   **Performance**: C++ core ensures consistent business logic and high performance across all platforms.
*   **Native Experience**: No compromise on UI/UX. We use the best tools for each platform.
